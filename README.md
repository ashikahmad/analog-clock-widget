analog-clock-widget
===================

A simple [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) Widget. This will enable a classy simple themeable analog clock on your desktop to make it more sleek and useful.

Basic idea (and default theme) is ported and improved from a tutorial of [Toby Pitman](http://css-tricks.com/css3-clock/).
Other themes are extracted from various win7 clock gadgets. So those may not be used considering copyright.
Those are only for example purposes to show how to add and apply a new theme. You can always create/collect images to have your own dreamed theme live!
